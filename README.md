# pdfleserfx

Pdfleserfx is a simple, open source desktop app for *reading* PDF files on your computer. It aims 
to be completely usable on touchscreen devices without mouse or keyboard. Further, it tries to
give the user more fine-grained control over the rendering of the PDF pages on the screen than conventional
PDF apps.

Current features include:
- fullscreen mode, page previous/next, all toggleable with a double-tap
- an overlay background color selectable by the user for easier reading on glossy screens
- manual setting of the dpi resolution used for rendering the PDF page
- user-defined border cropping
- document-specific reading settings are stored in an embedded database
- quick navigation to the last five read documents
- cross-plattform: Windows, Linux, macos

Planned features:
- support for TOCs
- improved touch usability
- localization
- faster application startup using GraalVM

## Getting started

Checkout the project and make sure that you have JDK 15 installed on your machine.
This should get you started:
```
./mvnw compile exec:java
```

If you want to use pdfleserfx more permanently, you might want to create an application image using **jpackage**:
